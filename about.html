        <h1><u>About the Site</u></h1>
        
        <p>
            This site shows the amount of death caused by the road -mostly from cars- from each country in 2013. Some countries shows 0 road deaths because the World Health Organization did not collect the data from that country. Below there is a picture of a car and when you hover over it, it will give a fact about road deaths! This site was created because the WHO does not have a good system of showing the data because there are a lot of different topic each with multiple sub-topics and a ton of data within them. This site will allow the user to focus on one topic and learn and see the data and try to understand it better.
