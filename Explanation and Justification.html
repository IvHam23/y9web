            <td>i. For a sites like the world health organization, people do not care for the information unless it is any use to them. The website has an enormous amount of information and data for one person to look through all of it because they are curious. Since there is so much data for different topics it can get overwhelming and it could be very confusing and people can get lost if the data is not organized well. Having a site that focuses of one specific topic will be more appealing because if someone wants to learn about that topic they could just search and go to that website instead of clicking through one site trying to find what they want. With the website specifying on one topic or the general idea of the topic with things that connect to it, it can be more convenient and less time consuming for the user.
