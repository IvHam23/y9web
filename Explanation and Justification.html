                For a sites like the world health organization, people do not care for the information unless it is any use to them. The website has an enormous amount of information and data for one person to look through all of it because they are curious. Since there is so much data for different topics it can get overwhelming and it could be very confusing and people can get lost if the data is not organized well. Having a site that focuses of one specific topic will be more appealing because if someone wants to learn about that topic they could just search and go to that website instead of clicking through one site trying to find what they want. With the website specifying on one topic or the general idea of the topic with things that connect to it, it can be more convenient and less time consuming for the user. Having a canvas in the website will make it more appealing and to have something other than data and writing for the user to look at.

                For my personal website, there is a lot of neat functions I would like to put in to make it more appealing, convenient, and detailed for the user. Some ideas that I would like to incorporate are having an interactive canvas that will allow the user to see a globe that when they hover over a country, it will give the statistic of the road death in that country (Got idea from second website). I would also include a paragraph or two explaining what the data is about and what the topic is about so the user has some information and idea of what the website is for. Also, a function where the user can choose what gender they want to see, and also similar to it is a function that will allow the user to choose which countries they would like to see and compare multiple countries similar to what some classmates had on their hockey pool application. This is a rough idea as of what I want to ad for now. As I keep on working on this project, I will definitely add more functions or take away things along the way to make it best fit for the users’ experience.

                1. This website is a really good site because not only does it give the data to the user but it gives a lengthy paragraph about the data and what it means. The world health organization website only gives the data probably because it would take to long to do so for all the other datasets they have. The data on wikipedia also has in depth data for example “Road fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants per year” and more. For the world health organization they only have the amount of people killed per country. That is another reason why having a website for one topic is much better that all together. Wikipedia also has a neat function that allows you to organize the data in the column and makes it go from the highest to lowest or lowest to highest. In this site there are a couple of images to show the map of the world with different shades of yellow to illustrate the amount of road deaths in each country.

                2. This site is called “world health rankings live longer live better”. The site has canvas on top that has a picture with the outline of the globe. When the user hovers over the countries it shows a colour that states if that country has a high or low road deaths. The user can change it to see only high or low countries or all at the same time. Under the canvas there is a table with all the data and countries. There is a button that allows the user to change from only men to woman or both which is a neat feature I might include in my final project. On top of the canvas there is a pull down tab that shows other topics which is a cool function because if a user wants to explore more things, than they could.

                3. This website has a canvas of what a car accident looks like and on top of it has a fact about car accidents. When the user scrolls down the page, there is a lot of writing explaining the topics of public transport affords little safety in many places, low-priced cars, high-priced risks, etc. After all the writing there is a table with the top 25 countries with the highest road traffic death rate. The table has 3 columns, the first is the rand, second is the country, and the third is car accident deaths (Per 100,000 Inhabitants). Even though this website only has 25 countries instead of all of them, it is still a well produced site, other than the fact that it has too much writing. In my opinion if feel that one or two paragraph(s) is good because it summarizes everything and the user will be more attracted to visuals rather than reading a bunch of things.

                Analysing what other people have done to make their websites opens the student’s mind and gives them ideas that they might incorporate in their own project (of course changing it so it is not copying). Students can see what work or what does not with having different things in a website so when they make their own, they could put all the good things in so it will be the best for the user or who they intend it to be for. For example from the three websites I looked at they all gave me some really neat ideas to put in my project.
        </p>
        
        <p>
                1. Having an interactive canvas of the globe so when the user hovers over a country it will show that country’s road death amount that year
        </p>
        <p>
                2. Having a function where you can look at different countries using a pull down tab and comparing them with other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
                3. Having a function where you can change which gender you would like to see (either male or female or both)
        </p>
        <p>
                4. Having around two paragraphs of writing to inform the user about the topic and what the data represents
        </p>
        <p>
                5. Having a help button if the user gets stuck or is unaware of what things do
